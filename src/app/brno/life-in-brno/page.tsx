            Brno&apos;s gastronomic and coffee scene has grown from modest to
            great do downright extravagant. Instead of convincing you here,
            we’ll let others do the talking: here’s what The Guardian thinks
            about Brno’s restaurants and bars – ‘Czech out Brno for a cheaper,
            calmer city break’; and this is what The New York Times had to say
            about the drinking/eating scene here – ‘In Brno, Drinks for Morning,
            Noon and Night‘. <br/> One of the recent guides published by the Brno
            municipality is the Gourmet guide available online and in print.
            Mind that there are some very posh fine dining places here, luckily
            you can find a great food in Brno without spending a fortune – and
            since Brno is a progressive city, this counts even for vegetarians,
            vegans and people with various eating habits.
