            Cost of living
          </h1>

            The cost of living in the Czech Republic is much lower than in the
            old EU member states and you will be able to live comfortably
            without spending large sums.

            The Czech crown (in Czech “koruna”), abbreviated as Kč (CZK) is the
            official currency of the Czech Republic. The crown is formally
            divided into hellers (haléř), which are no longer in use. They are
            shown in prices and rounded off to the nearest crown. The
            approximate conversion rate is 100 CZK / 4 EUR or 25 CZK / 1 EUR.
            Used coins are 1 Kč, 2 Kč, 5 Kč, 10 Kč, 20 Kč and 50 Kč; used
            banknotes are 100 Kč, 200 Kč, 500 Kč, 1 000 Kč, 2 000 Kč and 5
            000 Kč. Although the Euro is occasionally accepted by some
            restaurants, hotels and shops, the Czech crown is generally the only
            currency that can be used. Most supermarkets, shops, restaurants and
            institutions accept payment cards. There are many cash machines
            located especially in the city centre and in the campus.
