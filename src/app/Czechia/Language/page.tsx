            Czech is a West Slavic language spoken by over 10 million people. It
            is very similar to Slovak language to the point where Czechs and
            Slovaks can speak in their respective languages and understand each
            other with no problems. For non-slavs, Czech is considered hard,
            since it is an inflective language with a lot of rules concerning
            grammar, orthography, diacritics, interpunction etc. Actually, it is
            so complicated, that even adult natives make mistakes on regular
            basis. Fortunately, English is completely sufficient for your life
            in Brno. And if you want to learn some Czech phrases, you can go for
