            Got a computer, a laptop or a tablet? Chances are your electronic
            devices are using Czech-made antivirus software! Few people are
            aware that Avast, one of the world leaders in antivirus software and
            cyber-security, originates from communist Czechoslovakia. Founded as
            a communist cooperative under the name Alwil in the late 1980’s by
            Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kucera, two computer prodigies studying in
            Prague, Avast became a private company in the 1990’s. Today, it’s
            one of the world’s leading cyber-security companies, protecting the
            electronic devices of nearly half a billion users around the world.

            Last year, Avast filed an initial public offering on the London
            Stock Exchange in one of the biggest technology listings in the U.K.
            in history. A striking symbol of the Czech Republic’s bustling tech
            culture and illustration of the home-grown, highly digitally-skilled
            workforce in electronics and security-related digital products.
