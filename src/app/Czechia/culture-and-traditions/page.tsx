            Czechs can be more pragmatic than traditional, but when they keep
            customs, they do so proudly. A typical blend of pagan Slavic
            tradition with the Christian one gives local customs interesting
            twist which is sometimes confusing for the expats, so make sure to
            look up our major holidays before living through them! Otherwise,
            whipping with a willow branch, dressing up as the Grim Reaper,
            burning witches or throwing Old Hag Winter into the river may seem a
            little over the top. On the other hand, our Christmas are generally
            peaceful with a lot less commerce and stress compared to our
            American counterparts and instead of Halloween, we have quiet All
            Souls&apos; Day with no dressing up and running around.
